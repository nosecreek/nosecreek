#### Hi, my name is Dustin and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
I enjoy [hiking](https://dustin.lammiman.ca/hikes), [building things](https://dustin.lammiman.ca/teardrop), and [making ice cream](https://dustin.lammiman.ca/icecream). You can also find me on [my personal website](https://dustin.lammiman.ca/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dustin-lammiman/). Here are a few projects I've been working on lately:

## GROCERY TRACKER
Grocery Tracker is a tool for saving money on your next trip to the grocery store. It keeps a price history for groceries from some of the major Canadian grocery chains, and can email you updates when your favourite groceries go on sale! Think camelcamelcamel, but for groceries.

If you'd like to test it out without creating an account, feel free to use this demo login:

- Technologies: React, NodeJS, MongoDB

## BUCKETS VIEWER
[Buckets](https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/) is a fantastic envelope based budgeting software created by One Part Rain. Buckets Viewer is a web app for viewing these budget files online. It works by opening the budget file (which is actually a SQLite file) from Google Drive or Dropbox.

A [demo budget file](https://github.com/nosecreek/buckets-viewer/blob/b5900b688e19f8726f90c71fce17340b846fa7d8/Sample.buckets) is available

## NOSE CREEK WEB DESIGN
Nose Creek Web Design is a web design company I founded in 2009 to design, create, and host websites for local small businesses. This has included designing custom WordPress themes and plugins, including a complete RV Rental booking system. Since 2013 I've stepped back from the business a bit, but I continue to maintain and update websites for several existing clients.
